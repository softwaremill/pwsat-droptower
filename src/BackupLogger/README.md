# Backup logger
Backup logger is responsible for UART logging of payload data generated by the main controler. In case of main controller's failure it is used as a backup payload data source.

`CONFIG.TXT` file is used by an OpenLog UART->microSD data logger: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13712

# Reset button on Arduino board
Reset button on Arduino board resets only the main controller. The reset button doesn't reset the backup logger. This means that in every Arduino's reset the recorded timestamps start from zero. Be careful during data analysis.
